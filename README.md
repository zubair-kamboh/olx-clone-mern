OLX-Clone

<h5>Here is the OLX clone that I build with MERN Stack</h5>

A multi-vendor marketplace where anyone can signup and buy/sell stuff they don't need anymore. It has a great client app. Major features are Categories, Filters, Details page, Ad Views, and Clicks. Users can post new ads, delete their ads update their ads. They can update their profile, and reset their password.

It also includes features like email verifications, jwt authentication, google maps, and places. New features like chat, wishlist, and admin panel will be added in future versions

Tech I Used:
1- Reactjs
2- Redux
3- Nodejs
4- Expressjs
5- Mongodb
6- Google Maps
7- Google Places Autocomplete Api
8- JWT Auth
